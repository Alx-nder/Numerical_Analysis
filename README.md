# numerical_methods
This repo focuses on the development and application of numerical schemes for the resolution of complex problems encountered in the physical sciences, namely differential equations.

The material in this repo serves as a guide to 
1. Mathematically describe and understand common physical systems from a differential equations perspective
2. Understand and apply basic discretization methods for the resolution of differential equations
3. Efficiently organize and solve complex coupled differential equations numerically
4. Understand the underlying mechanics of the numerical methods applied in commercial software
